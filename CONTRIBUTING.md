Guidelines
---

Thank you for contributing to MinigameCore API! Have a read through before you start contributing.

### Report issues and requesting features
* Make the title of the report/request clear. A ```Doesn't work` is not very helpful, compared to a `Teleportation Events
don't work as expected`.
* Reporting bugs:
    * Describe how we can reproduce the bug, step by step.
    * Describe what you expected.
    * Describe what actually happened
    * If possible add screenshots and console logs(as [pastebin] or [gists]) where necessary.
* Requesting new features:
    * Tell as what you would like to see.
    * Provide justification/ use cases of how this is useful.
* If the need be, we will ask for more information, so we have it right.

### Pull requests
Like to contribute some code? You are welcome! Just make sure you are aware of some things.

#### Code Style
MinigameCore follows the [Sponge Code Conventions](https://docs.spongepowered.org/master/en/contributing/implementation/codestyle.html).

#### Submitting your Pull Requests
In your PRs, please make sure you fulfill the following:

* Provide a justification for the change - is it a new feature or a fix to a bug?
* Before sending a pull request ensure that your branch is up to date with the branch you are targeting. This should
normally be master.
* Do not squash commits unless directed to do so, but please _rebase_ your changes on top of master when you feel your
changes are ready to be submitted - _do not merge_. We will squash the commits in a way we feel logical.
